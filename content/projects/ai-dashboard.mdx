## Overview
An experimental control center for AI research and operations. Built with Next.js App Router, designed to surface insights from external automations (Supabase, PostHog, n8n, SerpAPI).

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Tooling:** Husky git hooks, ESLint, Prettier, Commitlint
- **Architecture:** npm workspaces, conventional commits
- **Status:** Phase 1b complete (baseline app), ready for Supabase integration

## Key Features
- Opinionated DX with quality gates
- Hot reload development environment
- Foundation for vector search and background jobs
- Comprehensive documentation (ADRs, troubleshooting guides)

## What I Learned
- Git SSH authentication workflow (replaced HTTPS)
- Monorepo integration patterns
- Nested repository cleanup (`rm -rf .git` for subfolder integration)
- npm workspaces for multi-package projects
